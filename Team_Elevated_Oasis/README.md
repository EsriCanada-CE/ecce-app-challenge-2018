# Elevated Oasis 

## Overview
Elevated oasis is designed to help the user calculate the cost of ownership and savings associated with the installation or retrofit of a new Green Roof. 
With the use of 3D buildings, Shade at different times of day, roof area, and min. slope, different buildings throughout the west-end of Vancouver can be explored for possible green roof sites. 


## Usage Instructions
### How to install this application
Download the ElevatedOasis.zip folder and decompress the files within the folder. These files include further application information and scripts to be browsed at the leisure of the user. The application can be launched through the index.html. This must be done with the Google Chrome or Firefox platform. 

### Select your Location
Browse through the 3D map of West-End Vancouver to find the location of your choosing. Click on the building for further information about whether this building is suitable for green roof development.

### Information Tab
Users can read through this tab in order to understand how to use the application. 

### Learn More Tab
Click this tab located on the main splash screen in order to read about the benefits, incentives, and lifespan of green roofs. Click the links for further information and details on who you can contact.

### Further Contacts Tab
Also located on the main splash screen, this tab provides information on local businesses that provide green roof consulting and installation.

### Shade Analysis
Click through the drop-down menu, located on the bottom right of the screen and choose a desired time of day to analyze. This allows the user to visually determine the amount of shade covering each rooftop at different times in the day based on surrounding buildings.

## Limitations
During the building vectorization, it was not possible to refine buildings into individual features, given the time constraints. As a result, the features derived from the .las files are in groups based on buildings that are within three meters of one another – according to the classified .las file. This affects the output of the rooftop area. 

This application is limited to use in Google Chrome and Firefox.

## Future Improvements
* Spending a greater amount of time refining building vectorization
* Increase the size of the study area
